      <h2>What’s up, I’m Arjun.</h2>
      <p>
        I’m the 15 year old COO and co-founder of <strong>Rebel Labs</strong>, an AI research lab for science discovery. Our first vertical builds models that accurately capture exchange correlation in Kohn Sham Density Functional Theory to accelerate materials discovery. My days blend research partnerships, commercialization strategy, and the operational rituals that keep the science moving from lab to deployment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Rebel Labs, I co-founded <strong>Opporly</strong>, a college admissions platform, where I led a 15 person marketing team distributed across the United States, Canada, Abu Dhabi, and beyond. We reached thousands of learners and millions of views by living in Instagram Reels and TikTok. Those channels already carried trust with the community we served. That journey taught me to respect channel market fit and the compounding trust of storytelling, lessons I now apply to deep tech ventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is my notebook for business development, technical storytelling, and the craft of connecting frontier research with the people who need it.
