        <h2>Building Opporly</h2>
        <p>
          Opporly started as a scrappy idea to give students on-demand college admissions guidance. I co-founded the platform and led a 15 person marketing team stretched across the United States, Canada, Abu Dhabi, and more. Together we shipped daily content, ran community interviews, and scaled a brand that reached thousands of learners and millions of views.
