        <h3>Opporly’s playbook for meeting Gen Z where they scroll</h3>
        <p>
          Opporly is a college admissions platform built to feel familiar to students the moment they land on it. When I led our 15 person marketing team, we tested every channel we could touch. Instagram Reels and TikTok kept beating our other experiments because they let us show transparent stories and quick wins. Once we leaned in, the funnel produced a steady flow of signups and even attracted an acquisition offer from a competitor trying to buy our momentum. The lesson: match the format your community already trusts and keep shipping value there.

        <h3>The art of connections for founders building in education</h3>
        <p>
          Relationships move faster than campaigns. I spent hours each week with career counselors, district technology leads, and scholarship organizers to understand where Opporly could actually help. Their feedback shaped content calendars, product roadmap priorities, and the language we used in every talk. When they championed us, the introductions landed with credibility we could not manufacture alone. Whether I am growing Opporly or Rebel Labs, I start by mapping the humans closest to the problem and listening before asking anything in return.

        <h3>Designing partnership funnels that compound community</h3>
        <p>
          Partnerships at Opporly were more than a badge swap. We co created workshops, scholarship breakdowns, and office hour series with every collaborator. Each pilot ended with a simple recap that highlighted what worked, what needed to improve, and the next experiment on the calendar. That rhythm converted short term wins into recurring programs. I bring the same structure to Rebel Labs as we team up with researchers and industry labs. When both sides leave the table with a clear next action, trust compounds.
