        <h2>The long version</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Arjun Gayam, a 15 year old COO and co-founder at <strong>Rebel Labs</strong>, an independent AI venture focused on accurately modeling exchange correlation in Kohn Sham Density Functional Theory. Our mission is to unlock faster, more precise materials simulations for teams designing the next generation of energy, climate, and compute breakthroughs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously I co-founded <strong>Opporly</strong> and led a 15 person marketing team spread across the United States, Canada, Abu Dhabi, and other hubs. We reached thousands of learners and millions of views by embedding in Instagram Reels and TikTok. That journey taught me to find the channel where your audience already trusts and then meet them there with value.
        </p>
        <p>
          My craft is business development that feels personal: partnering with researchers, shaping narratives, and making sure every handshake has a follow-through plan that translates research into real-world deployment.
